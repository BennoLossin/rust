`UnalignedField` or `Field` was manually implemented, which is not allowed.

Erroneous code examples:

```compile_fail,E0806
use std::field::UnalignedField;

pub struct MyStruct;

unsafe impl UnalignedField for MyStruct {
    type Base = ();
    type Type = ();
    const OFFSET: usize = 0;
}
```

```compile_fail,E0806
use std::field::{Field, field_of};

pub struct MyStruct(usize);

unsafe impl Field for field_of!(MyStruct, 0) {}
```
